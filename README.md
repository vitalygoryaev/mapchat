mapchat is a geolocation-based chat that allows people around to communicate with each other.

**Works** in latest safari on **iphone** and **ipad**.<br />
**Doesn't work** in latest **chrome** or **firefox** because geolocation is not allowed on http. Need to set up ssl certificate for server.

When you go to website the app needs to get your location before you see any messages and able to send messages.<br />
Click on certain message and see from where message was sent on the map.<br />
Scroll to top to load history.
